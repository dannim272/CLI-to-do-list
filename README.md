# A very simple CLI to-do list 

### to Add a task:
```bash
./main add
```

### to List the tasks:
```bash 
./main list
```

### to Delete the tasks from the list:
- you will get an option whether to delete specific tasks by **id** or **all** of them
```bash
./main delete
```

## To add in the future
- **actually** implement the deletion by ID
